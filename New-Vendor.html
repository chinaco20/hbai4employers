										<p>
											There should be a do list? There should definitely be a don't list.
										</p>
										<p>
											note to self. find a way to put picture of the actual mailer form.  we are splitting this page as it is not into
											first time user focused instructions and then a separate page for download forms.
										</p>
										<p>The actual title on the report fomr is "Hawaii Carpenters Joint Trust Funds Employers Monthly Report To Trustees".
											Around here we just call it the Monthly Report, so if you say that we, that is what we will.
											The (ER) is symbolic for Employ(ER) as opposed to Employ(EE) contributions, and is fairly
											universal for fringes and benefits. 
										</p>
										<p>For now we are only able to offer spreadsheet forms for the Master Agreements, which are the IU and DL rate codes. This
											is a work in progress and we expect to offer all rate codes as spreadsheet forms eventually.

											What topics should be in the next section: due dates, checks payable to, where to mail payment.

												<h3>What is a layout?</h3>
												<p>
													Each layout has a specific target employer, based on their roster size and payroll system. You could also think of a
													layout as a template of sorts, they are all based on the same formulas and functions in the background. Each
													spreadsheet form file name begins with an underscore and then a letter code that indicates the layout used for that
													rate. You can refer to the table below on their meaning as well as the criteria for when they can be the most
													effective. Having several layouts was a way to accommodate many different roster sizes and payroll methods accross
													the base of employers. Why the funny prepend? It is mostly for us to be able to keep the forms organized when we
													alphabetize the files in a folder.
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Cheat Sheets</h3>
												<p>Cheat sheets show rates as we have them loaded in our accounting system and in the spreadsheet forms that we make
													available yearly.  They contain a full rate grid for all apprentice classes, a summarizing note of any changes
													from the previous fringe rates and an itemized list of all the rates that changed and what the previous agreement rate was.
													If we have supporting documentation from the empowered organization or association, that will be attached as well.

											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Penny Variances</h3>
												<p>
													Penny variances between the total due in our accounting system and the employer payment were ingrained in our spreadsheet
													forms. The inaccuracy was shorting members by a penny in certain situations causing employers to make adjustments to agree
													with our spreadsheet total while we were in turn would make equal and opposite adjustments to credit the member accounts.
													If you are seeing these variances, we have a report form that will correct this. If you would like to see when these penny
													variances occur click the More button.

									<!-- Downloads -->
										<h2>Downloads</h2>
										<p>Click the hyperlink in the Downloads column to retreive the .xlsx file, these will go directly
											to you Downloads folder. Any .pdf files will open in a new browser tab and from there you can
											choose to save to your computer or not.</p>
										<blockquote><p>Just go with this for now, eventually(?), I will need to to make individual employer logins. This 
											will allow using a shopping cart model to download forms themselves. The list of items they can
											"buy" would be dynamically generated based on which employer it is.  When they checkout it would
											(i think this is not too hard) create a zip folder for them and send it to their download folder.</p>

											This is just a test table to see how it looks. But it is a sort of mockup of what i am shooting for. You click on the rate code to
											open the cheat sheet. or should i make a button. Crap i guess i just make another version of the table to see waht that looks
											like.

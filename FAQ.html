							<h1>FAQ</h1>
							<h2>Should I file a report when no work was performed?</h2>
							<!-- <h2>If no payment is required, why should I file a report?</h2> -->
							<p>
								Mailing a report form to you indicates that your status the particular agreement is active. Although you can
								file a 0 hours report later without penalty, your account will not be considered current until then and you
								will lose the right to receive a Trust Fund Clearance.available for accounts that are current. 0 hours reports must still filed to receive a clearance.
							</p>
							<h2>We don't anticpate further work on Hawaii projects, can we be on inactive status?</h2>
							<h2>Can we be on inactive status?</h2>
							<p>
								There is a  check box on most of the monthly report forms for this, but we prefer that you send us
								the request in writing. If you have more than one active agreement you can be selective about the agreement(s)
								that are to be inacitve. If you have just one active Master Agreement left, inactive status would mean closing your
								account with us and doing a closing audit. While you are still a signatory to HRCC you can re-open your account
								with a simple written request.
							</p>
							<p>
								obligated under the collective bargaining agreement. Being inactive means that you will no longer receive the report form by mail which means you are no longer obligated
								to file a report with us if no payment is required.  However, this <em>does not absolve the employer</em> from making any
								required contribution payments should their situation change without notifying us. To change to active status we just need a request in
								writing, an email will suffice.
							</p>
							</p>
							<h2>What charges are on a delinquency invoice?</h2>
							<p>There are 3 charges based on the contributions due for the report as submitted. (should i explain what amount due means?)
								Any short payment will be included in the bill as a discrepancy.  include explantion of due amount and a skosh more detail on how that affects invoice. Sarah says liquidate damages are eligible to be waived subject to eligitlity.  Charges are:
								<ol>
									<li>Liquidated Damages which is $20.00 or 20% of the contribution, which ever is greater.</li>
									<li>Fund Interest at a rate of 12% per fund per annum.</li>
									<li>Lost Earnings on 401k benefit, if applicable. Calculations are done using the
										<a href="https://www.askebsa.dol.gov/VFCPCalculator/WebCalculator.aspx" target="_blank">VFCP Calculator</a>
										website.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								Payments to settle delinquency invoices are due to our office within 10 business days of the invoice date. Payment
								should not be sent directly to First Hawaiian Bank.
							</p>
							<h2>How do Liquidated Damages Waivers work?</h2>
							<p>When you start your account with us you are alloted 4 Monthly Liquidated Damages Waivers (Monthly LDW) and 
								4 Weekly Liquidated Damages Waivers (Weekly LDW) to be used on a revolving basis. To use an LDW the request must
								be made in letter form. The available LDW is then surrendered to us for 364 days starting from the pay period ending
								date (PPE) on the delinquency invoice. The hold is not afixed to the waiver request date nor the invoice date nor
								the invoice settle date. As an example, a Weekly LDW used on an invoice with a PPE of September 25, 2020 would be available
								for any new delinquency invoice with a PPE date of September 24, 2021 or later.
							</p>	
							<p>
								Per the delinquency policy, if your account is current, over the next 12 months you are allowed up to 4 monthly Liquidated Damages Waiver and 4 weekly Liquidated Damages Waiver for a twelve month period.
							
							</p>
							<h2>What happens if my account is no longer current?</h2>
							<p>
								explain what current means? go into NRN's here?  or as a separate topic? Should this be in the ER and EE pages respectively/
							</p>
							<h2>What forms of payment do you accept?</h2>
							<p>only paper checks. money orders?</p>

							<h2>How do I request a Trust Fund Clearance?</h2>
							<p>
								Should this actually be titled "what is a trust fund clearance and how do i get one?". Or maybe split into two faq's.
